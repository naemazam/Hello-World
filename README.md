## Before Start


# JavaScript

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled and multi-paradigm. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation and first-class functions. Wikipedia

First appeared: December 4, 1995; 25 years ago

Designed by: Brendan Eich of Netscape initially; others have also contributed to the ECMAScript standard

Stable release: ECMAScript 2021 / June 2021; 5 months ago

Paradigm: event-driven, functional, imperative

Typing discipline: Dynamic, weak, duck

JavaScript files are stored with the . js extension.
## Print Hellow World In JS

```JavaScript
<script>
  console.log('Hello, World!');
</script>
```


# Python

Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

 }
}
```

# Kotlin

Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise.
